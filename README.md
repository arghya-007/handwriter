# text to hand : A web app that allows you to convert typed letters to handwriting.

A program that allows you to create your own font by filling out a template and scanning it, later to be used as a means of conversion from text to handwriting. It imitates real handwriting by using random characters to minimize repetition and custom spacing to save the document for printing.
